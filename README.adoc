== How to test

* RestVerticle exposes port 7777 for REST Requests and 5005 for JVM Debug (Debug enabled by default).
* OrderVerticle exposes port 8888 for REST Requests and 5006 for JVM Debug (Debug enabled by default).
* For ease of use I commited postman collection in main module directory.
* On Login user gets SessionId, he must pass this session in any other rest request in header.
* Add order request json format example:
```
{
    "orderId":"1",
    "orderName":"MyOrder1",
    "orderDate":"12.12.2023"
}
```
* Hazelcast cluster configuration is in Common/src/main/resources/hazelcast_config.xml
* Default allowed users are in  RestVerticle/src/main/resources/default_permissions.csv
