App by Saar Ox

== Requirements

[.yellow]*- Docker installed and running on your machine*
```
* Docker installed and running on your machine
* Docker settings->general option "expose daemon on port 2375 over TLS" should be enabled
* If you still have host name error while packaging run this command in cmd: netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3375 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=2375
```

== Local deploy instructions
*To package your application.*
[.red]*Note: this will also create docker images both in project location and in running docker instance. no need to write load image commands.*
```
mvn clean package
```

*To run your application:*
```
docker-compose up -d
```

== How to test

* RestVerticle exposes port 7777 for REST Requests and 5005 for JVM Debug (Debug enabled by default).
* OrderVerticle exposes port 8888 for REST Requests and 5006 for JVM Debug (Debug enabled by default).
* For ease of use I commited postman collection in main module directory.
* On Login user gets SessionId, he must pass this session in any other rest request in header.
* Add order request json format example:
```
{
    "orderId":"1",
    "orderName":"MyOrder1",
    "orderDate":"12.12.2023"
}
```
* Hazelcast cluster configuration is in Common/src/main/resources/hazelcast_config.xml
* Default allowed users are in  RestVerticle/src/main/resources/default_permissions.csv
